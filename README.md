Project Title: We protect evidence from tampering and ensure its immutability with our secure solution.

Project description: We aim to resolve the problem of evidence tampering and ensure that evidence remains secure and confidential. To achieve this, we are using the Aptos blockchain platform to store evidence 
                     data on immutable blocks, making the evidence unchangeable. Access to the evidence data will be restricted to administrators only, with the ability to assign multiple administrators.

Key Features: 1. Immutable Records: Evidence cannot be changed or deleted once recorded.
              2. Decentralized Storage: Evidence is stored across multiple nodes, enhancing security.
              3. Secure Access: Only authorized users can access the evidence.
              4. Audit Trails: All actions on evidence are traceable and transparent.
              5. Smart Contracts: Automates evidence handling and validation.

Project Vision: we aim to protect the integrity of evidence, making it the global standard for secure and trustworthy evidence management.
